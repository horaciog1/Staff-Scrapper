# Staff-Scrapper

## The purpose of this script is to scrape all the contents of a webpage containing the Names of the Staff members and their Titles, Roles, or Class Taught. Then the scripts saves all this information to a csv file

## The script should work with all schools that have the Name and Title available in their website.

 To scrape a different school just change the URL before /staff?page_no={}


stuff to add
   - should I ask for the url? 
   - should the url be passed as an argument when executing?
   - maybe excracting the tag 'department'
   - extracting only STEM related Courses? what about departments?
   - executable file? mac? windows? terminal based?
